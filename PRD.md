Harvard Public Schools – Landing Page Redesign PRD
1. Executive Summary

The Harvard Public Schools (HPS) landing page will be redesigned as a modern, one-page website that provides all key district information at a glance. The new landing page will replace the current multi-page, text-heavy site with a single, scrollable homepage that is visually engaging, mobile-friendly, and easy to navigate. By consolidating important content – district news, events, quick links for families, school information, and contact details – into one page, the site will offer a welcoming “front door” to the district. This redesign will improve user experience for parents, students, staff, and community members by making frequently-needed information accessible within one or two clicks (or taps)
morweb.org
morweb.org
. Ultimately, the new landing page will reflect HPS’s values of dynamic learning and belonging, encourage community engagement, and serve as a central hub connecting users to the elementary, middle, and high school sites.

2. Research Findings Summary

Current Site Structure: The existing HPS website is organized into many pages and menus. Top navigation includes sections like Calendars, Employment, Departments, For Families, For Staff, School Committee, and Contact/Media. Each has multiple sub-pages (e.g. For Families menu lists arrival/dismissal times, bus transportation, bullying reporting, lunch menus, fee waivers, online payments, registration, tech support, etc.
psharvard.org
). The district also maintains separate websites for each school – Hildreth Elementary, Bromfield Middle School, and Bromfield High School – accessible via a “Schools” dropdown on the district site
psharvard.org
. The homepage features a slideshow of photos, a mission statement (“We commit to providing a high quality education centered around dynamic learning and personal well-being in a community where everyone can FIND BELONGING.”) prominently displayed
psharvard.org
, quick-link icons (for PowerSchool, ParentSquare, etc.), a news section, a Diversity/Equity/Inclusion blurb, a message from the Superintendent, recent newsletters, and an upcoming events list. The footer contains contact information and non-discrimination policy
psharvard.org
.

Key Insights:

Comprehensive Content: HPS provides extensive information on its site – from department info (e.g. Business Office staff and budget documents)
psharvard.org
psharvard.org
 to student services (special education, Title IX, preschool)
psharvard.org
, policies, and forms. This shows the district values transparency and compliance. Important resources for families (bus schedules, lunch menus, portals) are included, indicating what the district considers important for daily school operations
psharvard.org
.

Navigation Challenges: The current navigation is complex and repetitive. Some information appears in multiple places (for example, “Bus Transportation” is a top link and listed under both District Office and For Families menus)
psharvard.org
psharvard.org
. Users may need to click through deep menus to find what they need. There is no obvious search bar or language toggle on the site, which can hinder usability for new or ESL users. The desktop menu may not translate well to mobile, risking that mobile users struggle to find content quickly (a critical issue given ~75% of prospective users access school sites on mobile devices
morweb.org
).

Visual/Layout Weaknesses: While the homepage does include engaging photos, the overall design appears dated and text-heavy. Key announcements are presented as long text blocks (e.g. a DESE monitoring press release is fully displayed on the homepage
psharvard.org
), which can overwhelm users. The “Latest News” and “Upcoming Events” sections are functional but not visually highlighted – events are listed in a plain list (with duplicate entries, likely due to calendar feed quirks) and news items beyond the first are simply linked text. The site lacks modern visual elements like easily scannable news cards, interactive calendars, or video embeds on the landing page (though an embedded video exists on a subpage
psharvard.org
). Branding is inconsistent – the motto “Find Belonging” is emphasized, but there is no strong use of school colors or a distinctive visual theme to tie the page together.

Content Gaps & Outdated Elements: Some content and features expected of a modern school-district site are missing or not prominent:

Streamlined Alerts/Announcements: The current site does not have a clear alert banner for urgent announcements (e.g. snow days or emergencies) – everything is mixed in “Latest News.”

Language Support: There is no visible language translation tool, despite serving a diverse community.

ADA Features: Aside from a dedicated Accessibility page in the footer, it’s not clear if the site meets modern accessibility guidelines (e.g., color contrast, alt text on all images). The presence of a “Mac OS Tabbing” instruction overlay suggests accessibility is considered, but the implementation is clunky
psharvard.org
.

Interactive Elements: No social media feeds, testimonial highlights, or interactive map are on the homepage. Social media are only listed on a separate page
psharvard.org
, which likely reduces their visibility.

Content Freshness: Some menu items appear to be legacy or rarely updated (e.g. “Superintendent Search Subcommittee” is still listed
psharvard.org
 even if a superintendent has been in place, and “HES In-House” staff pages suggest internal content is exposed on the public menu). This clutter can confuse users.

Opportunities: The research shows a big opportunity to simplify and modernize the HPS web presence. By condensing essential information onto one landing page, we can eliminate redundant navigation and surface the most-used content for families. Modern K-12 websites emphasize clear calls-to-action and quick access to resources – for example, one top-ranked district site features a clean homepage with direct links to the parent portal and calendar, prioritizing functionality for parents and staff
morweb.org
. HPS can adopt similar best practices, such as an integrated calendar widget (to increase engagement with school events
morweb.org
) and bold, high-contrast action buttons for important tasks (e.g. “Register Now”)
morweb.org
. There is also an opportunity to highlight HPS’s strengths (small community feel, high-quality education, innovative programs) in a visually appealing way – something currently missing. Overall, the new design can greatly improve user satisfaction by making the site intuitive, up-to-date, and welcoming, turning the district’s vision of “dynamic learning” and “finding belonging” into an online experience.

3. Target Users

The new landing page will serve a broad audience of public users, primarily:

Parents and Guardians: Both current and prospective. They need quick access to daily essentials (student grades portal, lunch menus, bus routes), news updates, event calendars, and enrollment information. Parents should immediately feel the site is speaking to them – highlighting resources to support their children’s education and opportunities to get involved.

Students: Primarily older students (middle/high school) who may check the site for announcements, calendar (exam schedules, events), and links to learning resources or tech support. The design should be student-friendly and inspiring, so students see themselves represented in the content (photos of peers, inclusive language).

District Staff and Teachers: While staff often have internal portals, they still visit the public site for information like district news, policies, or to use quick links (email login, work orders). The landing page should have a section or clear link for staff resources (or at least not make staff dig for the For Staff page). A user-friendly site also reflects well on staff pride in the district.

Community Members and Taxpayers: Residents of Harvard (and Devens) who want to stay informed about the schools – including school committee updates, district performance, or community use of facilities. They might visit the site for public information (budget documents, strategic plans, meeting schedules). The landing page should present the district as transparent and community-focused, with easy access to public reports and ways to engage (like attending events).

Prospective Families/Newcomers: People considering moving to Harvard or newly moved families. For them, the landing page acts as a first impression of the district’s quality and culture. They are looking for an overview of what makes HPS special – academic excellence, student well-being, extracurriculars – as well as practical info on how to enroll their children (“New Student Registration”). The new page should entice prospective families with a friendly tone, highlight achievements (e.g. strong test scores or “A” rating), and clearly direct them to registration and contact information for further questions.

By focusing on these users, the landing page will emphasize simplicity and relevance – making sure each group’s top tasks can be accomplished quickly. (For example, a parent should see a “Lunch Menu” or “Parent Portal” button immediately; a prospective parent should see a welcome message and a “Register Now” CTA, etc.)

4. Goals of the New Landing Page

The redesigned HPS landing page will have the following measurable goals:

Improve Information Accessibility: Ensure that 100% of key information and frequently used services (news, calendar, portals, contacts) are reachable within one click or tap from the homepage. This will be measured by a simplified menu and presence of quick-link buttons (reducing the need to navigate deep menus).

Increase User Engagement: Boost the time users spend on the site and their interaction with content. For example, aim for a 20% increase in time-on-page and more clicks on news/events compared to the current site (by presenting news and events in an attractive, easy-to-browse format).

Mobile Optimization: Achieve full mobile responsiveness with a design that works flawlessly on smartphones and tablets. A goal is to score high on mobile usability tests (e.g. Google Lighthouse) and ensure no important content is hidden on mobile. Success means parents and students can use the site on-the-go without frustration (aligning with the fact that ~75% of school site interactions are on mobile
morweb.org
).

Enhanced Community Engagement: Encourage more community interaction with the district. This could be measured by higher attendance at events (supported by the prominent events listing on the page) or increased newsletter sign-ups if a subscription CTA is included. Another goal is to reduce calls to the front office by providing clear information online (e.g. families find answers on the site instead of calling).

Highlight District Identity and Values: Through content and visuals, reinforce HPS’s core values (academic excellence, inclusivity, well-being). A qualitative goal is that 100% of new visitors should understand the district’s mission/vision within a few seconds of landing on the page. This will be achieved by featuring the HPS vision statement or a friendly tagline prominently.

Drive Enrollment and Retention: Make it easier for prospective families to take action. A specific goal is to increase inquiries or online registration starts by having a visible “New Student Registration” call-to-action on the homepage (trackable via click-throughs). Additionally, convey a positive image that helps retain current families by fostering pride (perhaps measured by feedback or increased followers on social media linked from the site).

Ensure ADA Compliance and Inclusivity: Meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards on the new page. The goal is to have zero major accessibility issues (as tested by an accessibility checker and manual reviews). This includes providing alt text, high-contrast text, keyboard navigation, and a language translation option. A compliant site not only avoids legal issues but improves usability for everyone
morweb.org
.

Easy Maintenance: Although not directly user-facing, a goal for the product team is that district staff can easily update the page (news, events, etc.) without technical hurdles. This can be measured by training time and update frequency – e.g. staff will be able to post a news item or update an event in less than 10 minutes. A well-organized one-page site will reduce the maintenance burden compared to managing dozens of pages.

By hitting these goals, the new landing page will be considered a success. It will be a one-stop information hub that improves satisfaction for all users and showcases Harvard Public Schools as a forward-thinking, welcoming district.

5. Information Architecture (IA)

The new landing page will be structured in a logical, user-friendly sequence of sections from top to bottom. Below is the proposed one-page IA outline:

Header & Navigation: A persistent top bar with the district logo, site title, and minimal navigation. The header will include an “Our Schools” menu (allowing quick access to Hildreth Elementary, Bromfield Middle, Bromfield High sites) and utility icons (language selection, search bar, social media links or an icon). The navigation on this one-page site will use anchor links to scroll to sections (e.g., “News”, “Events”) as needed, keeping the page uncluttered.

Hero Section: A full-width welcome section featuring a large, high-quality banner image (or slideshow) representative of HPS (e.g., smiling students or a vibrant classroom scene). Overlaid text will display a concise district tagline or vision statement that encapsulates HPS’s mission (for example, “Every student thriving – learning, growing, and finding belonging at HPS”). A prominent call-to-action button may be placed here (“Enroll Now” or “Learn More About HPS”) to guide new visitors.

Quick Links Section: Immediately below the hero, a set of icon-based quick links for the most sought-after resources. These will be visually distinct buttons (with icons and labels) in a grid or row. Anticipated quick links include: Parent Portal (Grades), New Student Registration, Lunch Menu & Payments, Bus/Transportation Info, District Calendar, and Contact/Staff Directory. This section ensures that parents and students can jump straight to essential services.

Academics/Teaching & Learning Highlight: A brief overview of the district’s academic program and student support. This section will have a short paragraph introducing HPS’s commitment to high-quality teaching and whole-child development, possibly titled “Teaching and Learning at HPS.” It might highlight a couple of focus areas or initiatives (curriculum alignment, innovation, inclusive practices) with a “Learn More” link to curriculum or department pages. This section connects to content currently found on the Teaching & Learning page
psharvard.org
psharvard.org
, distilled for the homepage.

District News & Announcements: A section for latest news. It will show 3-5 recent news headlines or updates, each with a title, date, and a one-line summary or teaser. For instance, news items could include school committee updates, district newsletters, or important announcements (like the press release currently on the site). Each item will link to a full news post or PDF. The section may be titled “Latest News” with a clear “View All News” link that could go to a news archive page if needed. This design invites users to scan headlines instead of confronting a wall of text
psharvard.org
.

Upcoming Events (Calendar Preview): A calendar snippet showing upcoming important dates. This could be displayed as a list of the next 4-6 events with dates and titles (e.g., “Nov 25 – Day 5 (All Schools)”, “Dec 10 – Winter Concert 6:30 PM”). A “View Full Calendar” button will lead to the comprehensive district calendar page or a Google Calendar integration. The events shown can be a mix of academic calendar days and special events, possibly filterable by audience. The goal is to promote events and make it easy for families to know what’s coming
psharvard.org
psharvard.org
.

District Highlights / Special Initiatives: A section to spotlight key district initiatives or points of pride. For HPS, this might include Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) efforts, strategic plan highlights, or achievements (e.g., “Awarded Blue Ribbon School” or “Niche A+ District”). For example, a subsection could feature a short blurb like “Diversity, Equity & Inclusion: HPS is committed to an inclusive community where everyone finds belonging” with a link to the DEI page or related letter
psharvard.org
. Another highlight could be a statistic or accolade (if available, such as graduation rate or a ranking) to build community pride. This section can use small images or icons and concise text.

Superintendent’s Message: A personal touch – a greeting from the Superintendent. This section will show a small photo of the Superintendent (Linda Dwight) alongside a short welcome message (2-3 sentences) in a warm, first-person tone. For instance: “Welcome to Harvard Public Schools! As Superintendent, I’m proud of our caring community and commitment to excellence. We value every student, every day – thank you for partnering with us in education.”
psharvard.org
. A “Read more” link might lead to a dedicated Superintendent’s page or the full welcome letter if one exists, but the homepage will capture the essence. This reassures visitors that leadership is engaged and approachable.

School Directory Section: A visual listing of the three schools in the district with links. Each school will be represented by its name, maybe an emblem or photo, and key info like grades served. For example: Hildreth Elementary School (PreK–5), The Bromfield School – Middle School (6–8), The Bromfield School – High School (9–12). Each will have a “Visit Site” button to take users to that school’s separate website. This section helps users navigate to specific school info and acknowledges that those sites contain additional details (like teacher pages, athletics, etc.).

Contact Information & Map: A section toward the bottom providing the district’s contact details for easy reference. It will show the District Office address (27A Massachusetts Ave, Harvard, MA 01451), a phone number, and a general contact email. Next to this info, we can embed a small Google Map showing the location of the District Office or the town for context. There may also be a short contact form or a prominent “Contact Us” button if direct inquiries via the site are desired (or it can link to the “Contact/Media” page). This ensures that anyone needing to reach the school administration or find directions can do so readily on the landing page.

Footer: A concise footer that appears at the very bottom (this may blend with the contact section visually). The footer will include essential links and notices: for example, Site Map, Accessibility statement link, Privacy Policy (if applicable), and the district’s non-discrimination policy statement or a link to it. It will also include small icons linking to official district social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram as appropriate) so visitors can easily connect on those platforms. Additionally, a language selection dropdown could be placed here if not in the header, to allow translation of page content. The footer will likely repeat the district name or logo and a copyright notice (e.g., “© 2025 Harvard Public Schools”), similar to the current site
psharvard.org
, but in a more modern, clean format.

This one-page IA flows from broad welcoming content down to specific details, which aligns with how a user typically scans a homepage – first impressions at top, detailed info as they scroll. Importantly, each section is clearly delineated, making it easy to find relevant information quickly. The structure also balances informational content (news, events, academic blurb) with navigational utility (quick links, school sites, contact info), covering all the functions the current site provides but in a more consolidated way.

6. Content Requirements

All content on the new landing page will be carefully crafted to be clear, concise, and community-friendly. Below is a list of the required content pieces and their proposed copy (rewritten in an approachable tone):

District Name and Logo: Prominently display “Harvard Public Schools” at the top. If a logo or mascot exists, include it in the header for branding. (E.g., the text logo could be accompanied by a small emblem of the school if available.)

Tagline / Vision Statement: A short, inspiring statement that encapsulates HPS’s mission. Proposed tagline: “Dynamic Learning, Inclusive Community, Every Student Thrives.” This is derived from the current vision (“high quality education… dynamic learning… personal well-being… everyone can find belonging”
psharvard.org
) but in simpler, positive terms. It should convey warmth and excellence. This tagline will appear in the hero section in large text.

Hero Call-to-Action: A brief welcome or action prompt overlaying the hero image. For example: “Welcome to Harvard Public Schools! – Learn about our programs or enroll today.” This could be paired with a “Enroll Now” button that links to the New Student Registration process. The tone here is enthusiastic and inviting.

Quick Link Button Labels: The text for each quick link icon. These must be short and self-explanatory:

“Parent Portal” – for PowerSchool login (so parents/students can check grades).

“Student Registration” – for new families to start the enrollment process (currently “New Student Registration”
psharvard.org
).

“Lunch Menu & Payments” – combined access to cafeteria menus and the online payment system (this covers what’s now Lunch Menus, Forms, and MySchoolBucks).

“Transportation” – information on bus routes, schedules, and transportation policies (currently Bus Information
psharvard.org
).

“Calendar” – link to the full district calendars page or a separate calendar view.

“Staff Directory” (or “Contact Us”) – a quick link to find staff contact information or reach the district office. We can choose “Contact Us” to encompass directory and general contact.
Each of these should have a corresponding icon (e.g., a calendar icon, a bus icon, etc.) and will be written in Title Case for clarity. The language is straightforward and jargon-free.

Teaching & Learning Intro: A short paragraph (~2-3 sentences) summarizing the academic ethos of HPS, to replace lengthy department text with friendly language. For example: “Academics at HPS: We offer a rich, student-centered curriculum in a supportive environment. From elementary through high school, our educators focus on both rigorous learning and the well-being of every child. <a href='#'>Learn more about our teaching and learning goals.</a>” This text invites curiosity and pride in the district’s academic quality without overwhelming detail.

Latest News Headlines: Titles and snippets for recent news. Each news item will have:

A headline (e.g., “School Committee Update – Nov 10, 2025”
psharvard.org
, “District Newsletter – November 2025”
psharvard.org
, “Gluten Free Options Now Available”
psharvard.org
).

A date or date range, to set context.

A one-liner summary in friendly tone. For example, for the gluten free lunch news: “We’re excited to announce daily gluten-free lunch options for students with dietary restrictions – ensuring all our kids have healthy meals!”

If there’s a press release (like the Tiered Focused Monitoring example), rather than showing the full text, we’ll include a summary: “DESE’s Office of Language Acquisition will conduct a review of our English Learner Education program in December.” followed by a link labeled “Read More” to the full details or PDF. The language should be parent-friendly, explaining acronyms or jargon where needed (e.g., say “Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE)” once for clarity).
The tone for news items is factual but upbeat and concise. We avoid long, formal passages on the homepage.

Events Listings: For each upcoming event, include:

Date and Day: e.g., “Dec 10, 2025 (Thu)” – possibly formatted with an abbreviated month and numeric day for brevity.

Event Name: e.g., “Winter Instrumental Concert” or “No School – Holiday”. Keep it very short but clear.

Time (if applicable): e.g., “6:30 PM – 8:00 PM” for events like concerts or meetings
psharvard.org
. All-day events (like “No School”) can just say “All Day”.

If events are school-specific, we might add a tag, e.g., “TBMS School Council Meeting” might be labeled “Bromfield MS School Council”. But since this is the district page, we can list significant district-wide or multi-school events primarily.
At the end of the list, a link “View Full Calendar” will be included for complete details. The phrasing for events should be user-friendly (e.g., use “No School – Thanksgiving Break” instead of a code like “Holiday – No School” to be clear).

District Highlight Blurb(s): One or two short items to showcase district initiatives:

DEI Commitment: For instance, “Equity & Inclusion: We’re committed to a school community where everyone finds belonging. Learn about our ongoing diversity and inclusion initiatives.” This echoes the current statement but in plain language and could link to a DEI page or an open letter
psharvard.org
.

Strategic Plan or Achievement: e.g., “Strategic Plan 2022-2026: Our roadmap for the next five years focuses on innovative teaching, healthy school culture, and community partnership.” (Link to the strategic plan document
psharvard.org
.) Or if bragging a bit: “HPS was ranked #6 in Worcester County for public elementary schools (Niche.com).” – if such data is available and desired to show.
These highlights should be one sentence each, positive and understandable to a layperson.

Superintendent Welcome Message: A friendly greeting from the Superintendent, rewritten from the formal letter
psharvard.org
 into a more conversational tone. For example: “Hello and welcome! I’m Linda Dwight, Superintendent of Schools. Harvard is a place where every student is encouraged to grow, learn, and belong. I’m proud to lead a district that partners with families and the community to help children thrive. Thank you for visiting our site!” This is warm, inclusive (“every student”, “partner with families”), and much shorter than a full letter. It will be signed with her name and title for a personal touch.

School Listings Content: For each school, provide:

School Name and Level: e.g., “Hildreth Elementary School (PreK–5)”, “The Bromfield Middle School (6–8)”, “The Bromfield High School (9–12)”. Use the full official names as known, and include grade spans so new families immediately know which grades each covers.

Possibly a mini tagline or fact (optional): e.g., “Home of the Cubs – A caring start to learning.” for Hildreth, or “Excellence in Grades 6-12” for Bromfield. This is optional flavor text to differentiate the school links, if desired.

A “Visit Website” button or link for each, which will take users to the respective school’s homepage. If there is any distinction needed (like Middle vs High are separate sites), label accordingly (they might prefer one Bromfield site with sub-sections, but since they created separate URLs, we’ll treat them as separate).
Content here is minimal – mainly identification and navigation – but must be clear. It assures users that each school has more info available.

Contact Information: Up-to-date contact details for the district:

Address: “27A Massachusetts Avenue, Harvard, MA 01451” (as in current site
psharvard.org
). We will present it in a single line or two lines, and possibly make it a link to Google Maps for convenience.

Phone Number: “978-456-4140” (main line) and Fax: “978-456-8592” as currently listed
psharvard.org
. If we include fax, it can be in smaller text since fax is less commonly used now.

General Email: If the district has a general inquiries email (e.g., info@psharvard.org or a contact form link), we’ll include that with a mailto or form button labeled “Email Us” or “Contact Us”.

Office Hours: Optionally, mention “Office Hours: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM, Mon–Fri” (from current info
psharvard.org
) to set expectations for when someone might be available to respond.
The language for contact info is straightforward. E.g., “District Office: 27A Massachusetts Ave, Harvard, MA 01451 | (978) 456-4140”.

Footer Notices and Links: Brief content for the footer:

Non-Discrimination Policy Statement: This must be included as per legal requirements, but we can shorten it to one line with a link. E.g., “HPS is an equal opportunity institution and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin, age, disability, or sexual orientation in its programs and activities.” and then link to a page with the full policy (the current text is long
psharvard.org
, so linking is cleaner).

Accessibility Link: Text like “Website Accessibility” which links to details on how the site meets accessibility or who to contact for issues (this is typically a requirement).

Privacy Policy (if the district/site has one).

Site Map link if needed, though on a one-page site it might not be as necessary – but since the current site had one, we can include it for completeness, or replace it with a simple “©2025 Harvard Public Schools” line.

Social Media Icons: No text needed, but the icons will link to the official Facebook, Twitter, etc. We will ensure alt text like “Facebook” icon for accessibility.

Possibly a Translate dropdown labeled in text like “Translate: [English ▼]” if using Google Translate plugin – the label should be clear in English so users know they can switch language.
The footer content tone is formal (due to policy text) but as minimal as possible to avoid clutter. It should not distract from the main content, just provide legal and navigational footer info.

All the above content will be written in plain language – no education jargon (or if we use terms like “ELE program” we’ll spell it out), no overly bureaucratic tone. We want a friendly, informative voice. For instance, instead of “It is the policy of the Harvard Public Schools not to discriminate…” (passive voice), we say “Harvard Public Schools does not discriminate based on …” (active voice and simpler).

Before go-live, all content will be verified for accuracy (e.g., phone numbers, dates, etc.) and approved by district officials. But as outlined, these content requirements cover everything that must appear on the landing page, ensuring nothing crucial from the old site is lost – only rewritten or reorganized for better clarity.

7. UX & UI Requirements

The new landing page’s design will follow modern UX/UI best practices, tailored to a K–12 school district context:

Mobile-First & Responsive Design: The layout must adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (smartphones, tablets, desktops). On mobile, content should stack vertically with clear tap targets (buttons at least ~44px tall) and no horizontal scrolling. The design should be tested on common devices to ensure readability (e.g., text scales appropriately, images resize or crop without losing important content). Given high mobile usage, mobile performance is paramount
morweb.org
.

Clean, Minimalist Layout: Embrace a clutter-free design. Use plenty of white space (or neutral background space) between sections so the user isn’t overwhelmed. Each section (Quick Links, News, etc.) should be visually separated, possibly with alternating background colors or subtle lines. Avoid heavy textures or overly decorative elements; keep it simple and professional yet welcoming. The overall page should have a consistent style – using the same family of fonts and design elements throughout.

Intuitive Navigation: Simplify navigation to just what’s needed on a one-page site. A top nav bar can have very few items (possibly just an “Our Schools” dropdown and an icon menu). The navigation and any dropdown menus should be accessible (keyboard navigable, and on hover/focus states clear). Include a visible search bar (or at least a magnifying glass icon leading to a search field) so that users who prefer can quickly search the site. If a user scrolls, the header can remain sticky at top for quick access, or a “back to top” button can be provided for convenience.

High-Contrast & Readable Text: All text shall meet contrast standards against its background for ADA compliance
morweb.org
. Fonts should be clear sans-serif (for example, a font like Open Sans or Helvetica for body text) with sufficient size (aim for ~16px base font on desktop, scaling for mobile). Headings should be larger and perhaps in a friendly but professional font variant. Use a limited color palette for text – mostly dark text on light background or vice versa – to ensure readability.

Visual Hierarchy & Calls-to-Action: Establish a strong visual hierarchy. The most important information (like the tagline, quick links) should stand out immediately, using larger text or distinctive styling. Buttons (CTAs) such as “Enroll Now” or “View Calendar” should use high-contrast colors that draw the eye
morweb.org
. They should also change appearance (e.g., slight highlight) on hover/focus to indicate interactivity. Each section should have a clear title (e.g., “Latest News”) using consistent heading styles so users can easily scan the page. Important actions should not be buried in text links; make them buttons or otherwise prominent.

Engaging Imagery: Use high-quality photos that reflect actual Harvard Public Schools students, staff, and community. The hero image(s) especially should be impactful – smiling students, engaging classroom scenes, school events – to evoke positive emotions. Avoid stock photos that feel generic. If a slideshow is used, ensure it’s not too fast and includes controls (with an option to pause, as indicated by the current site’s Pause/Play). Images should have descriptive alt text for accessibility (e.g., “Teacher reading to children on mats in a classroom”
psharvard.org
). Including at least one short video or interactive media (like a drone shot of the campus or a student testimonial video) could greatly increase engagement
morweb.org
, but if not feasible at launch, ensure the design can accommodate a video in the future.

Section-Based Scrolling: Design each content section to fit logically in the viewport (on desktop) and use anchor links or menu shortcuts to jump to sections. For example, tapping “News” in the nav would scroll down to the News section. This gives a one-page site a feel of a multi-section site without separate pages. Scrolling behavior should be smooth. Also, ensure the URL can reflect sections (for deep linking) using anchor IDs (e.g., adding “#news” to link directly to the news section).

Color Palette: Choose a modern color scheme that aligns with the district’s identity and is visually appealing. Ideally, incorporate school colors or local hues. (If HPS has no fixed colors, we might use a palette that conveys trust and vibrancy: e.g., navy blue or dark green for headers and buttons to convey trust and stability, paired with a bright accent like golden yellow or teal to signal friendliness and highlight important elements. Neutral whites or light grays can be backgrounds to keep it clean.) The colors should complement the photography and not clash. Use at most 2-3 primary colors with others as neutrals. Ensure all colors chosen have sufficient contrast (e.g., white text on navy blue is good; avoid light grey on white).

Typography & Iconography: Use a consistent font family for body text and a complementary one for headings if desired. The tone should be approachable – for instance, a sans-serif font for a modern look and maybe a slightly more stylized font for titles if it matches the school’s character (but nothing overly decorative that hurts readability). Icons used (for quick links or UI elements) should be clean, vector-style icons (think Material Design or FontAwesome style) that are easily recognizable (e.g., a school bus icon, a calendar icon). They should be used sparingly and always with a text label to avoid any ambiguity. All icons and images should have proper alt tags.

Forms and Interactive Elements: Any forms (like a contact form or newsletter signup) should be minimal and easy to use. Use clear labels and provide feedback (e.g., a confirmation message when a message is sent). Ensure form fields are accessible (proper labels, focus states). For interactive elements like accordions or tabs (if any, perhaps for FAQs or so), use standard controls that are usable via keyboard and screen readers.

Performance Optimization: The page should be optimized for quick loading, given it will have rich media. Use appropriately compressed images (without noticeable quality loss) and consider lazy-loading images that are further down the page so the initial view loads faster. Ensure any scripts or integrations (like the calendar or translation widget) do not significantly drag down performance. The target is to have the page interactive within ~3 seconds on a typical mobile network.

Accessibility & Compliance: As mentioned, follow WCAG guidelines: all interactive elements must be reachable by keyboard (e.g., use skip links if needed to jump to main content, ensure focus outlines are visible on links/buttons), provide text equivalents for media, and avoid any known accessibility pitfalls. Additionally, incorporate an Accessibility link or widget so users who need accommodations know how to request help or adjust the site (some modern school sites offer tools to increase font size or toggle contrast; at minimum, having the Translate option covers language needs).

Consistent Branding Elements: Maintain consistency with any existing branding – e.g., if the district has a slogan like “Find Belonging” that is often capitalized, consider stylistically how to incorporate it (maybe as part of the design motif). If there are district logos or a mascot (like Bromfield’s mascot for high school), possibly use a subtle version as a watermark or icon in the footer. However, ensure the district’s brand (not the individual schools) is front and center on this page, since it’s the district homepage.

Testing & Browser Compatibility: The design should be tested in all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and gracefully degrade for older browsers if any community members use them. Use standard HTML/CSS practices to ensure wide compatibility. Also test with screen readers (like NVDA or VoiceOver) to make sure the reading order of the page makes sense and all content is announced properly.

In summary, the UX/UI of the new page should be simple, elegant, and focused on user needs. It should immediately communicate what can be done on the site and guide users to their goals with minimal friction. A parent visiting at 10pm on their phone to check tomorrow’s schedule should find it in seconds; a new family should feel the warmth of HPS and be drawn into learning more. The design will speak to both efficiency and the positive spirit of the Harvard school community.

8. Feature Requirements

The landing page will include several functional features to enhance user experience. All features will be public-facing (no login required), aligned with the content above. Key feature requirements:

News/Announcements Feed: A dynamic feed or module that displays recent news posts. This should be easily updatable by staff (through a CMS or even by embedding an RSS feed or blog feed if one exists). It should show at least headlines and dates, and allow clicking to read more. Ideally, this feed can automatically pull the latest 3-5 news items tagged for “District News” so updates require minimal page redesign. This feature makes it easy to keep content fresh (updated newsletters, announcements, etc.)
morweb.org
.

Integrated Calendar Preview: An embedded calendar element or event list that pulls data from the district’s Google Calendar or calendar system. It needs to always reflect upcoming events without manual editing of the page. Features to include: ability to click an event to see details or add to one’s personal calendar, a “View Full Calendar” link, and perhaps filters if needed (though on the simple landing page, filters might not be needed; we can show a combined view). Integration could be via a Google Calendar iframe or a plugin that shows events in a list format. This ensures the Upcoming Events stay current automatically
morweb.org
. (For example, if a snow day is added to the calendar, it should appear in this list in real-time).

CTA Buttons: Prominent buttons for key actions like “Enroll Now” (linking to registration form/page) or “Contact Us”. These buttons must be visually distinct (brand color with high contrast text) and have hover/focus states. They should be placed in logical spots: e.g., one in the hero (primary CTA) and possibly one in the Superintendent’s message (“Read More” if linking to a full message) or near the contact section (“Send Us a Message”). Buttons should have concise labels and consistent styling site-wide.

Document Download Links: The page will provide access to important documents (like PDFs for the school calendar, strategic plan, or forms). Rather than listing many PDFs on the homepage (which can clutter it), we will include download links for the most critical ones in context. For instance, in the District Highlights, a link to the strategic plan PDF
psharvard.org
; in the events section, maybe a link to “2025-26 Academic Calendar (PDF)” if provided for parents. Another approach is to have a “Forms & Docs” quick link in the quick links section that goes to a resource page. For the PRD, the requirement is that any PDF link opens in a new tab (so users don’t lose the page) and is clearly labeled with its name and file type/size (for accessibility and transparency). This feature ensures parents can easily get commonly needed documents (like a bus form or school handbook) from the landing page.

School Directory/Links Module: As described, a feature listing the schools with links. This could be a set of cards or images. Each is clickable and takes the user to an external URL (the school’s site). We need to ensure these links open in a new tab (so that users can return to the district page easily). This module should be easy to update in case a school name changes or a new school is added (not likely in this small district, but the system should allow editing the list). It’s essentially a static list of external links but presented visually (feature aspect is in the design).

Embedded Google Map: In the contact section, embed a Google Map frame showing the district office location. This is a nice-to-have feature that helps visitors get directions quickly. The map should be zoomed appropriately to show the school location in town. As an interactive feature, users can click “View larger map” to be taken to Google Maps. We must ensure the embed has appropriate title/alt text for accessibility (or provide a text address alongside, which we will). The feature should not slow down the page significantly; we may use a static map image with a link as an alternative if performance is an issue.

Contact Form or Email Link: Provide a simple contact mechanism on the page. This could be a contact form (fields: Name, Email, Message) that, when submitted, emails a designated staff (like the district office). If implementing a form, include a confirmation message and basic spam protection (like a simple CAPTCHA or honeypot field). Alternatively, a “Contact Us” button that opens a mailto link with a district email address could suffice, but a form is more user-friendly (especially for users on public computers or who prefer not to launch an email client). The requirement is that this feature is easy to use and that messages reach the right inbox.

Social Media Integration: At minimum, include social media icon links (Facebook, etc.) in the footer or header that go to HPS’s official accounts
psharvard.org
. As an extended feature, we could consider embedding a social media feed (like the latest Facebook posts or Twitter feed) in a sidebar or section. However, given one-page simplicity, we might opt to just use icons. Ensure the icons are recognizable and open in new tabs. This feature helps drive community connection by encouraging visitors to follow HPS on other platforms.

Language Translation Option: Implement a Translate feature, likely through Google Translate or a similar plugin, to allow instant translation of page content into common languages (e.g., Spanish, Portuguese, etc., as relevant to the community). A button or globe icon labeled “Translate” can trigger a dropdown of languages. This feature is important for non-English-speaking families to access information easily. It must be easy to find (often placed in the top-right of the page). If using Google Translate, ensure the plugin’s display doesn’t clash with the site’s styling and that it’s obvious how to switch back to English.

Search Functionality: Provide a search bar that allows users to search the entire HPS site (and possibly even the school sub-sites if integrated, but at least the district content). The search bar could be an icon on the top menu that expands when clicked. It should index content like news posts, department pages, etc. This requires either a built-in site search (if using a CMS with search) or integration with a custom Google Search for the site. The feature should show results in a user-friendly way (perhaps as a dropdown list or a separate results page). The main requirement is that a parent can type something like “bullying policy” or “lunch menu” and quickly get to that info without manually navigating
morweb.org
.

Analytics Tracking: (Back-end feature) Implement Google Analytics or similar to track usage of the landing page – which links are clicked most, how users scroll, etc. This isn’t visible to users but is a requirement for evaluating the success of the site’s design against our goals. We should set up events for clicks on quick links, CTA buttons, etc., to gather data. The PRD includes this as a feature so that the development team includes the necessary script and configurations for analytics.

No Login/Account Features: As specified, the page will have no user login or portal beyond linking to external ones (like PowerSchool). We will ensure that nothing on the page prompts a login or requires an account. The “Login” link that existed for staff on the old site (likely for content editors) will not be present on the public-facing page, or if it must exist, it can be tucked discreetly in the footer labeled “Staff Login” (but ideally, we remove it entirely from public view to avoid confusion).

Performance Features: Implement caching or static content delivery as needed so that the page loads quickly (especially important if there’s heavy media). Use a content delivery network (CDN) for images and have proper meta tags for social sharing (so if someone shares the site on Facebook, it shows a nice preview with the HPS logo or tagline). Again, not directly a user feature, but a requirement to ensure a smooth user experience.

Each of these features is aimed at making the site more useful and interactive without adding complexity for the user. They should all work together seamlessly – for example, the news feed and calendar feed keep content fresh; the search and quick links help find things instantly; the translate and accessibility features ensure everyone can use the site. All features will be tested thoroughly to be sure they function as intended (e.g., try submitting the contact form, try the calendar link on a phone, etc.). By including these, the landing page becomes a functional dashboard for the district, not just a static information page.

9. Brand & Tone Recommendations

To create a consistent and appealing identity for the Harvard Public Schools landing page, we provide the following brand and tone guidelines:

Voice & Tone: The website’s voice should be friendly, welcoming, and community-focused. Communications should sound like they come from a caring school community. Use inclusive language – e.g., “our students,” “our families,” “we are proud…” instead of impersonal or overly formal phrasing. The tone can be described as warm, optimistic, and confident. Even when conveying official information, it should not feel bureaucratic. For example, instead of “It is hereby announced that...” use “We’re excited to announce…” for positive news, or “Please remember…” for reminders. Always keep the audience in mind: talk to parents and community members as neighbors and partners. The Superintendent’s message, for instance, should feel like a personal note to the community. The underlying attitude should be encouraging and inclusive, aligning with the district’s emphasis on belonging.

Key Messaging: Emphasize belonging, excellence, and well-being throughout the content. The tagline and repeated phrases should reinforce that every student is valued. Avoid negative wording; focus on what HPS provides and believes. For instance, highlight successes (“award-winning music program” or “state-leading test scores” if applicable) in a humble, proud tone – celebrate achievements but remain community-oriented (use “we” not just “the district”). Ensure any motto like “Find Belonging” is presented in a positive, active manner (e.g., “Find Your Belonging at HPS” or “Where Everyone Belongs”).

Visual Style – Photography: Use authentic photos of Harvard Public Schools students and staff to build trust and relatability. The photography style should be bright, candid, and full of life – students actively engaged in learning (as seen in current images of kids on mats or collaborating at tables
psharvard.org
psharvard.org
), teachers interacting with small groups, sports or arts moments, and community events. Whenever possible, show diversity in these photos (various ages, backgrounds, abilities) to reflect inclusion. The images should generally have a warm or natural color tone (avoid overly filtered looks). Aim for a mix of close-ups (smiling faces, hands-on activity) and wider shots (school environment, group activities) to convey both personal and communal aspects of HPS. If using a hero slideshow, ensure each image tells a part of the story (academics, arts, community, graduation) and that they are high-resolution and not pixelated on large screens.

Visual Style – Colors & Icons: Choose colors that convey trust, positivity, and energy. A recommended approach is to use blue tones for trust and stability (commonly used in education sites) complemented by a bright accent like orange or yellow for optimism and action (for buttons or highlights). Another approach, if local school colors are known (e.g., if Bromfield’s sports color is maybe blue), incorporate that for consistency. Keep background colors mostly white or very light to keep the design airy; use color for headers, footers, and accents. Icons and graphic elements should be flat (no heavy shadows or 3D effects) and use the same color palette (e.g., outline icons in the same blue or gray). Maintain a clean and modern aesthetic – for example, use a simple icon set (all line style or all solid style, but not mixed) to avoid visual clash.

Layout & Design Ideas: The layout should likely be full-width (fluid) to utilize modern screen space, with content centered and images often spanning edge-to-edge for a contemporary feel. Consider using subtle background sections with a faint color or pattern to differentiate segments (for instance, the Quick Links section might have a light gray background to set it off from a white hero background). Incorporate some gentle animations for modern flair – e.g., fade-in content as the user scrolls, or slight hover animations on buttons (like a slight grow or color change) – to make the site feel dynamic but not distracting. The design can include rounded corners on buttons and cards to feel friendly (sharp edges can be perceived as too formal or harsh). For example, quick link icons could be in circular or rounded square buttons in the accent color, turning a slightly darker shade on hover.

Typography Recommendations: Use a clean sans-serif font such as Roboto, Open Sans, or Lato for body text to ensure readability on screens. For headings, you could use the same font family but in a bold style, or introduce a complementary font like Montserrat or Source Sans Pro for a little distinct character. The font size should be generous (e.g., 16px body, 32px or more for main headings on desktop) to create an open, easy-to-read feel. Avoid overly whimsical fonts; the style should be modern and approachable, aligning with an academic yet friendly environment.

Iconography & Graphics: In addition to functional icons (for quick links), consider small decorative graphics that fit the school theme, used sparingly – for example, maybe a faint watermark of the town’s emblem or a mascot paw print in the footer, if it exists, to personalize it. Or use academic motifs like book, pencil, graduation cap icons as subtle accents next to section titles or in the background of the hero (very subtle). All iconography should be consistent in style. If using custom illustrations (like stylized school building or children reading), ensure they match the tone (likely, actual photos are more impactful for this site than illustrations).

Sample Headlines & Text for consistency:

Hero Title: “Every Student. Every Educator. Every Day.” – a possible bold statement (taken from their Teaching & Learning page motto
psharvard.org
) that can stand alone as a headline conveying commitment.

Section Headings: Use straightforward titles like “District News”, “Upcoming Events”, “Welcome from the Superintendent”, “Our Schools”. This clarity in labeling helps all users, including those skimming.

Calls to Action: Use action verbs and friendly tone: e.g., “Register Now”, “Explore Our Curriculum”, “Join Our Community Event” instead of passive phrases. A good CTA example is “Schedule a Visit” if they ever offer tours, or “Subscribe to Newsletter” if relevant
morweb.org
. We likely will have “Learn More” as a common CTA for sections linking to more info.

Button Text: Keep it short and uppercase or title case for consistency – e.g., “READ MORE” on a news card, “VIEW CALENDAR” on events, etc., usually in all caps can give a modern look, but title case is also fine if that matches overall style.

Footer Slogan: We might include a short phrase in the footer like “Harvard Public Schools – Learning with Heart” or something akin, to reinforce brand at the very end. This is optional but can leave a positive note.

Content Tone Consistency: Ensure even routine info is phrased in the community-friendly way. For example, instead of a list of policies by code, have a sentence like “See our School Committee Policies” as a link. For alerts or emergency info, keep the tone calm and clear (e.g., “Schools will be closed on Jan 5 due to inclement weather.” – still friendly but direct).

Accessibility of Tone: Keep in mind that some families might not be fluent in educational jargon, so the tone should avoid acronyms or explain them. The brand should come across as helpful and knowledgeable, not elitist or overly academic. Harvard, MA is a small community; the site should feel neighborly.

In essence, all design and content choices should reinforce the idea that Harvard Public Schools is a caring, high-quality, and modern educational community. The branding should feel like an extension of the schools themselves: if a parent walks into one of the schools, the warmth and professionalism they feel should match what they saw online. Consistency in voice, visuals, and messaging will build that trust and recognition over time.

10. Full Wireframe Description (Text-Based)

Below is a textual walkthrough of the landing page from top to bottom, describing the layout and elements in each section as a user would encounter them:

Header & Top Bar: At the very top of the page is a slim bar on a contrasting background (e.g., dark blue) containing utility links. On the left, the Harvard Public Schools logo or name is displayed prominently (the logo could be an HPS emblem or simply stylized text “Harvard Public Schools”). On the right side of this top bar are small icon buttons: a language selector (globe icon) that opens the list of languages for translation, a search magnifying glass icon that expands into a search field when clicked, and possibly small social media icons (Facebook “f”, Twitter bird, etc.) linking to district social pages. This top bar remains visible (sticky) as you scroll, shrinking in height to maximize screen space, so that the school name or a small HPS logo is always available as a home button.

Right below (or integrated with the top bar) is the navigation menu. If the design merges it, the top bar might double as nav; if separate, then a second bar with nav links sits below the logo. The nav is minimal: one item might be an “Our Schools” dropdown. When hovered or tapped, it shows a dropdown list: Hildreth Elementary, Bromfield Middle, Bromfield High – each linked to those sites
psharvard.org
. Other nav items might be anchors to sections of this page: for example, “News”, “Events”, “Contact”. On mobile, this nav collapses into a hamburger menu on the right; tapping it slides out a menu with those same options and the school links. The overall header area has a clean background (maybe white or a light color if the top bar is dark) to ensure the logo and nav are highly visible.

Hero Section: The first content section is a large, full-width hero banner. It could be a static image or a looping carousel of 3 images fading in/out. Each image depicts a vibrant scene from the schools – e.g., elementary kids in a circle reading, middle school science fair project, high school graduation moment. Over the image, there is a subtle overlay to ensure text contrast (like a slight dark gradient at the bottom of the image). On the left side of the hero (for example), large text displays the HPS tagline: “Every Student, Every Day – Find Your Belonging at HPS.” (This combines their vision of belonging with an inclusive slogan). It is possibly two lines, in an easy-to-read font, and maybe the phrase “Find Your Belonging” is in a different accent color or font weight for emphasis. Below that, a smaller sub-text of one sentence: “High-quality education and a caring community for all learners.” – a brief value statement.

Beneath the tagline text, a bold CTA button labeled “Enroll Now” is placed, with a bright background (e.g., orange or green) making it pop. Next to it, a secondary link “Learn More” might be present (for those who want to explore more about the district if they’re not ready to enroll). These actions are aimed at prospective families. The CTA has a slight drop shadow or outline to stand out on the image. On mobile, the hero image crops to center the focus (like kids’ faces) and the text and button stack vertically, still visible without overwhelming the image.

If a carousel is used, small navigation dots or arrows appear at the bottom-right of the hero, allowing manual image switching. There’s also a “Pause/Play” control for accessibility (so users can stop the slideshow). Each image might optionally have a short caption in the corner like “Hands-on Learning in Grade 2” to give context, but this is optional.

Quick Links Section: Immediately following the hero (no need to scroll much to see it on a desktop) is a Quick Links panel. It might have a slightly different background color (light gray) to distinguish it. This section features a grid of 6 icon buttons (possibly 3 columns by 2 rows on desktop; a swipeable row on mobile or 2 columns by 3 rows on mobile). Each button is a rounded square with an icon and label. For example:

A blue button with a graduation cap icon and label “Parent Portal”.

A green button with an open door icon labeled “Student Registration”.

An orange button with a fork and knife icon labeled “Lunch Menu & Payments”.

A teal button with a bus icon labeled “Transportation”.

A navy button with a calendar icon labeled “Calendar”.

A purple button with an address book icon labeled “Staff Directory”.

These colors are consistent with the palette, and the icons are simple line drawings or fills. When you hover (on desktop) or tap (on mobile) a button, it highlights (e.g., slightly enlarges or changes shade) to show it’s active. Clicking a quick link either scrolls to a relevant section (for Calendar it might scroll to events section, or likely it goes to a dedicated page – in this case, it would link externally or internally: e.g., Parent Portal goes to the PowerSchool login, opening in a new tab
psharvard.powerschool.com
; “Lunch Menu & Payments” might open the food services page or an external payment portal).

This section is labeled visually by nothing more than the icons themselves – the design should make it obvious these are key links. However, we might include a heading like “Quick Access:” above the grid for clarity (in a smaller font). Overall, the quick links act as a dashboard for daily tasks, visually breaking up the page and directing users to those high-traffic destinations.

Teaching & Learning (Academics) Section: As we scroll, the next section is an academics highlight. It might have a white background again. At the top, a heading like “Academics & Programs” or “Teaching and Learning at HPS” is centered. To the left of the text content, we might place a representative photo – for example, a medium-sized image of students in a classroom or a teacher guiding a small group. (If the layout is full-width, we could even do a split: text on one side, image on the other).

The text here is a short paragraph: “At Harvard Public Schools, learning is more than just academics. Our curriculum is innovative and student-centered, and we support each child’s growth with inclusive teaching practices and enriching programs.” Following that is a bullet or checkmark list of a few key points (maybe 3) as a quick snapshot:

Rigorous, standards-based curriculum across all grades.

Dedicated teachers and ongoing professional development.

Commitment to equity, inclusion, and whole-child development.

These points are basically distilled from the Teaching & Learning page’s content
psharvard.org
psharvard.org
 but in parent-friendly bullet form. Underneath, a link styled as a button or simple text link says “Explore Academics” or “Learn More”, which could take the user to a curriculum page or the “Teaching & Learning” detailed section of the site.

Visually, this section should communicate “academic excellence” – perhaps by using an image of students doing science experiment or reading books. The tone is proud but inviting. If space allows, we might also highlight a special program here, e.g., “New Language Arts Curriculum” with a link to that YouTube video mentioned
psharvard.org
, but likely that level of detail is not on the main page. Instead, we keep it general with one “learn more” link.

Latest News Section: Next, we encounter the News & Announcements section. It might have a subtle background color (maybe an off-white or a very light school color tint) to set it apart. A bold heading, left-aligned, reads “Latest News”. Under this heading, we present the most recent 3 or 4 news items in a visually consistent way – e.g., news cards. Each news card could be a small box or just a horizontal list item:

Each item displays a date (e.g., Nov 17, 2025) and a title (e.g., “School Committee Update – Nov 10 Meeting”). The title is a hyperlink. Below the title, a short snippet (maybe 1-2 lines) from the news post is shown, such as: “Highlights from the latest School Committee meeting including policy updates and budget discussions...”.

Possibly an icon or small thumbnail could accompany each (for example, a tiny PDF icon if one is a PDF link, or a small generic icon for news). If one news item has an image (like a newsletter header), we might include a thumbnail, but to keep it simple, text might suffice.

There could also be a “News” icon or graphic next to the heading (like a newspaper symbol) purely decoratively.

The news items are separated by thin lines or ample spacing. After listing the few items, a link “View All News” or “Archive »” is at the bottom of this section, so users know they can find older news (this might link to a dedicated news page or even a PDF archive if that’s how they store newsletters). On mobile, these news items stack nicely and can be scrolled.

Importantly, if there is an urgent announcement, this design can accommodate it by simply making that item the first news card (and we could style it with an alert icon or in red text for emphasis – e.g., “School Closed Tomorrow Due to Weather”). But on a normal day, it just shows routine updates.

Diversity/Highlight Section (District Highlights): As a user scrolls past news, there might be a highlight banner. This could be a narrow full-width band with a strong background (maybe the district’s accent color). Inside this band, we could place one highlight item – for example: “🏫 Harvard Public Schools Strategic Plan 2022-2026 – Read about our goals for the future
psharvard.org
.” or “💡 Equity & Inclusion: Learn how HPS ensures every student feels they belong.”. Actually, we could incorporate two or three of these as a horizontal scrolling marquee or rotating text, but it might be simpler: one static highlight at a time. Another approach is to have multiple columns:

Column 1: “✨ Equity & Inclusion: Our commitment to belonging” with a short sentence and a link “Learn More”.

Column 2: “🎓 By the Numbers: 95% HS graduation rate, 1200+ students district-wide” (if we want to put a stat showcase).

Column 3: “📖 Strategic Plan: Guiding our district from 2022-2026” with link.
Each with a small relevant emoji or icon as I used (star, graduation cap, book) to draw attention, and all on that colored background.

However, we need to ensure this doesn’t become cluttered. It might be better to pick one key highlight at launch (like DEI). Since we already plan a DEI mention, let’s say this section is a DEI callout. For example, a background image or color, with text: “Diversity, Equity & Inclusion: Every student deserves to feel safe, respected, and included. See what HPS is doing to foster belonging for all.” and a button “Our DEI Initiatives” (linking to the separate DEI site or page
psharvard.org
). This acts as both a value statement and a navigation to more info. It’s visually separated and adds emotional appeal.

Superintendent’s Message Section: Scrolling on, we come to a welcoming section likely labeled “Message from the Superintendent” (or simply “Welcome Message”). This section might be laid out in a card style or speech bubble style to set it apart. It likely includes a portrait photo of Superintendent Linda Dwight – maybe a circular cropped headshot, about 100px diameter, positioned to one side (left on desktop, above text on mobile). Next to the photo, the text of her welcome message is presented in first person: “Welcome! It’s my pleasure to serve as Superintendent in this wonderful community. Our district welcomes all students and their families. We are committed to helping every child learn and grow in a safe, inclusive environment. Thank you for partnering with us – together we make Harvard Public Schools great.” (Something along those lines, ~50-60 words).

Her signature or name is shown below the message, e.g., Linda G. Dwight, Superintendent of Schools, perhaps in a cursive font or just italic to simulate a signature. Maybe also a small contact link like “Email: ldwight@...” if appropriate (though not necessary on the homepage). If the message is to be longer, we include a “Read more” link which goes to a dedicated page or PDF of a longer welcome letter, but our plan is to keep it short and sweet here, so that might not be needed.

The design of this section uses maybe a soft background color (light blue) and possibly an icon of quotation marks behind the text or at the top, to indicate this is a quote/personal message. It should feel approachable – like a note from the superintendent rather than a formal report. This personal touch adds warmth to the page.

Our Schools Section: Next, a section showcasing the schools. It has the heading “Our Schools” centered, perhaps with a small schoolhouse icon. Then we have three columns (on desktop) each representing one school:

Hildreth Elementary School – show maybe a small exterior photo of Hildreth or their mascot if any (or just a colored block with the school’s initials, if photos of buildings are not appealing). Under the name, smaller text: “Grades PreK–5” and perhaps the school’s street address (14 Massachusetts Ave, which is actually Bromfield’s address; Hildreth might be at 27 Mass Ave with District? Actually, they share the campus but anyway). And a button or link “Visit Website”.

Bromfield Middle School – indicate “Grades 6–8”. Possibly we combine Bromfield Middle and High in one Bromfield School entry if they prefer, but since they made two sites, list separately:

Bromfield High School – “Grades 9–12”.

Alternatively, present Bromfield as one and have two links (one to MS, one to HS) but that could confuse; better separate as requested.

Each school “card” might have a distinct accent color (or use the same style but with the school’s official color if known). The cards might have a slight shadow and on hover they lift a bit (interactive feel). Clicking anywhere on the card (or the button) takes you to that school’s site (in a new tab). Include perhaps a small arrow icon on the button to indicate external navigation.

On mobile, these would stack one after the other for vertical scrolling.

We could also include short motto if each school has one (often elementary might have like “Home of the [mascot]” or Bromfield might be “Bromfield School – Est. 1878” as a bit of heritage). But that’s extra; likely just name and grades suffice.

This section’s purpose is clear navigation out to the school-specific information and to visually affirm that the district comprises these three schools.

Contact & Location Section: As we near the bottom, we have a Contact Us section. It might be presented in a split format:

On one side (left on desktop): a contact information block. This includes:

District Office Address with a location pin icon: “27A Massachusetts Avenue, Harvard, MA 01451”. (We might make the address itself a link that opens Google Maps).

Phone icon and “978-456-4140”.

Fax icon and “978-456-8592” possibly, in smaller text.

Email icon and a general email or a “Contact Form” link. If we have a contact form modal, the link could trigger it.

Office Hours if we include them: perhaps a clock icon and “Mon–Fri, 8:00am–4:00pm”.
This info could be text with icons in a vertical list, or stylized like business card.

On the other side (right on desktop): an embedded Google Map showing a pinpoint on Harvard, MA. The map is small but zoomed to show the area around the school. If multiple schools in town, maybe a map with multiple pins (Hildreth vs Bromfield) but since they’re near each other it might just show one. But likely, one pin for “Harvard Public Schools District Offices”. The map embed has the Google controls and a link to enlarge. We ensure it’s responsive so on mobile the map is maybe above or below the contact info (or replaced by just a “View on Google Maps” button if embed is too tiny on a phone).

Possibly, if we implement a short contact form, it could appear here instead of the map or below it: e.g., three input fields (Name, Email, Message) and a Send button. However, to keep things simple and because an embedded map is nice, the form might be a link instead.

Underneath or integrated with this section, we might also list key contacts, like “Superintendent: Linda Dwight (email link)” and maybe “Main Office Admin Assistant: [Name] (email)”, depending on how personal they want to get. But the PRD suggests focusing on just the main contact point rather than a directory here, since we have a Staff Directory link already in quick links.

Footer: Finally, the page concludes with the footer bar. The footer could be styled in the same color as the header (e.g., dark background with white text) to visually bracket the page. It will contain:

The non-discrimination statement, likely abbreviated: “Harvard Public Schools is an equal opportunity employer and educator. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin, age, disability, or sexual orientation.” This might run as two small lines. If too long, we’ll say “See our Non-Discrimination Policy” as a link to a full page.

A row of small text links: Site Map, Accessibility, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use (if needed), and possibly Admin Login (if they insist on having a login link for staff to edit the site; if not, we omit to keep it purely public).

The copyright line: “© 2025 Harvard Public Schools. All Rights Reserved.” This is often centered or right-aligned.

Social media icons repeated (if not in header), small and maybe monochrome in the footer for a subdued look, linking out accordingly.

If we have mobile app links (the current footer shows Google Play and App Store icons, likely for ParentSquare), we would include small “Download our App” icons in the footer as well. We need to clarify if HPS has a custom app or if those were ParentSquare apps. If relevant, we can have a line like “Get the HPS App:” followed by app store icons.

The footer is the catch-all for compliance and additional navigation but will be kept visually unobtrusive. On a desktop, it could be multi-column (one column for statement, one for links, one for social icons). On mobile, it will stack into a neat block of text and icons.

When the user reaches the bottom, there might also be a “Back to Top” arrow floating button that appears (especially on mobile) after scrolling, so they can quickly jump back up to the header.

Throughout this wireframe description, the key idea is that each section flows logically and has a clear purpose, with consistent branding. Scrolling from top to bottom should feel like a cohesive story: starting with a broad welcome and key actions, moving through what’s happening now (news/events), highlighting what the district stands for (academics, DEI, leadership message), and ending with how to reach us and deeper info. Visually, it should go from a big picture (hero image of smiling students) to finer details (contact numbers) naturally.

This text wireframe guides the layout; designers will create corresponding visuals and spacing according to these descriptions. The result will be a one-page site that is easy to navigate by scrolling but can also be jumped through using the header menu or quick links.

11. Acceptance Criteria

For the project to be considered complete and ready for launch, the following acceptance criteria must be met:

Complete Content Integration: All content outlined in this PRD is present on the landing page, including the tagline, quick link icons (with correct labels and links), news headlines, events, superintendent message, school links, contact info, and required policies. No important content from the current site is missing – it has either been included on the page or linked (e.g., policies, strategic plan, etc.). For example, the vision statement is clearly visible
psharvard.org
, latest news items are up-to-date, and the non-discrimination notice is included.

Accurate Links and Functionality: Every link and button on the page is functional and correctly linked:

Quick link buttons navigate to the correct destinations (Parent Portal opens the PowerSchool site in a new tab, etc.).

School site links go to the correct URLs (Hildreth, Bromfield MS, Bromfield HS).

News “Read more” links open the full news or PDF as intended.

“View Full Calendar” displays the comprehensive calendar.

The search bar returns relevant results for sample queries (tested with terms like “lunch” or “policy”).

The language translation widget successfully changes the text to the selected languages.

Contact form (if implemented) sends a test message to the designated email, or the mailto link opens properly.

Responsive Design Verified: The page layout has been tested on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, smartphone) and in multiple orientations. All sections adjust appropriately – e.g., the quick links stack nicely on a narrow screen, text remains readable without zooming, images scale or crop without cutting off important content. No element should overflow or break the layout on common screen sizes. The menu works on mobile (hamburger opens and closes), and scrolling is smooth. Acceptance will include a check on an iPhone, an Android phone, and a standard laptop/desktop at minimum.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: The site functions and displays properly on at least the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. No critical features (like the carousel or search) should be broken or look significantly different across browsers. This will be validated by opening the page in each browser and performing basic interactions (click links, scroll, etc.).

Performance Standards: The landing page loads quickly and passes basic performance benchmarks. Specifically, initial load time should be within a few seconds on a standard home internet connection. Images are optimized (no placeholder “Image not found” broken links, and file sizes are reasonable for web). We will use tools or browser dev tools to ensure the page is not bogged down by large files or unnecessary scripts. If using a PageSpeed or similar score, aim for a score above ~80 on desktop/mobile. While a perfect score is not required, there should be no blocking issues like uncompressed huge images or missing files.

Accessibility Compliance: The page meets WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. This is verified by:

Running an accessibility checker (e.g., WAVE or Lighthouse) and addressing any major errors (like missing alt text, low contrast, missing form labels).

Manual testing: Can a user tab through the page logically (the focus order follows the visual order, menus can be operated via keyboard)? Screen reader test on the header and a couple of sections to ensure it reads meaningfully (for instance, the quick link icons have aria-labels or accompanying text so they’re announced properly). No content should flash or be a seizure risk (we have no such media planned).

The “Accessibility” link in the footer leads to either an accessibility statement or help page, fulfilling legal requirements.
If any user with disabilities cannot access important info, that must be fixed before sign-off.

Consistent Branding & Design Fidelity: The delivered page should match the agreed design in style and branding. Colors, fonts, icon style, etc., should be consistent with the design specifications. The tagline and tone should reflect what’s in this PRD. For instance, if we specified a blue and gold color scheme, the live page should not suddenly be red. This will be checked visually against design mockups or this description. Minor deviations are acceptable if they improve UX, but the general look and feel should convey a modern, friendly school website as described.

Content Accuracy and Approval: All textual content is proofread and free of typos or placeholder text. Factual information (dates, phone numbers, names) is correct. For example, ensure the phone number is exactly the one provided
psharvard.org
, school grades are correct, etc. The Superintendent’s name and title are correct. The Harvard Public Schools administration (or designated stakeholders) have reviewed the content and given approval, indicating it aligns with their messaging. We should have sign-off from at least the Superintendent or Communications head on the welcome message wording and any mission statement phrasing.

Integration with Existing Systems: If the page is part of a larger system or CMS, it should be properly integrated (e.g., news feed pulling from CMS posts, calendar pulling from Google Calendar). No orphan features: e.g., if “Subscribe to Newsletter” is a CTA, it should be hooked up to an actual newsletter system or email list. Essentially, nothing on the page is just decorative – each interactive element is hooked to its functionality.

No Login/Portal Needed: As required, the page is entirely public. We verify that no content prompts a login. The “Login” link that was on the old site (for editors) is either removed or hidden from public view (or at least labeled as an admin login if unavoidable). The Parent Portal quick link goes to an external login (PowerSchool), which is expected. There are no sections that say “please log in to view more,” etc. Any staff-only content (like “HES In-House”) should not appear on this public page or must be reworked for public consumption.

Client/Stakeholder Acceptance Testing: Finally, a round of UAT (User Acceptance Testing) with district stakeholders (perhaps a couple of parents, a teacher, etc.) should result in positive feedback – e.g., test users can find key info without guidance, and stakeholders feel it meets the project objectives. Any critical issues discovered in UAT are resolved. Complete means the page is ready to go live on the official domain with confidence that it serves the community effectively.

When all the above criteria are met, CloudCloud (the development agency) can consider the landing page build complete. The site will then be ready for launch, delivering a vastly improved user experience and meeting the goals set out for Harvard Public Schools’ online presence.
